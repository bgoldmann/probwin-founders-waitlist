## 📞 Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection & Assessment (0-15 minutes)

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Detect & Confirm**
   ```bash
   # Check system status
   curl -f https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health
   
   # Check monitoring dashboard
   # Review recent security alerts
   # Verify incident legitimacy
   ```

2. **Initial Classification**
   - Determine severity level using classification above
   - Document initial observations
   - Start incident log with timestamp

3. **Alert Response Team**
   ```bash
   # Critical incidents - immediate notification
   # High incidents - notify within 30 minutes
   # Medium incidents - notify within 2 hours
   ```

#### Detection Methods
- **Automated Alerts**: SecurityMonitoring system alerts
- **User Reports**: Support tickets or direct reports
- **External Notification**: Security researchers, law enforcement
- **Routine Monitoring**: Regular security reviews

### Phase 2: Containment (15 minutes - 4 hours)

#### Immediate Containment
1. **Isolate Affected Systems**
   ```typescript
   // Emergency system shutdown (if needed)
   // Disable affected user accounts
   // Block suspicious IP addresses
   
   // Example: Block IP in middleware
   const blockedIPs = ['192.168.1.100', '10.0.0.50'];
   ```

2. **Preserve Evidence**
   ```bash
   # Capture logs immediately
   # Take system snapshots
   # Document all actions taken
   
   # Example log collection
   supabase logs --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
   vercel logs --app your-app-name
   ```

3. **Assess Impact**
   - Identify affected users/accounts
   - Determine data potentially compromised
   - Estimate financial impact
   - Check compliance implications

#### Containment Strategies by Incident Type

##### Data Breach
```sql
-- Identify affected records
SELECT email, created_at, updated_at 
FROM waitlist_applications 
WHERE updated_at > '[incident_start_time]';

-- Check for unauthorized access
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE event_type = 'unauthorized_access' 
AND created_at > '[incident_start_time]';
```

##### Payment System Compromise
```typescript
// Immediately disable payment processing
const EMERGENCY_MAINTENANCE_MODE = true;

// Review recent transactions
const suspiciousTransactions = await stripe.paymentIntents.list({
  created: { gte: incidentStartTime },
  limit: 100
});
```

##### Database Compromise
```sql
-- Change all service keys immediately
-- Review database access logs
-- Check for unauthorized schema changes
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
```

### Phase 3: Investigation & Analysis (Parallel to Containment)

#### Forensic Analysis
1. **Timeline Reconstruction**
   ```sql
   -- Analyze audit logs for attack timeline
   SELECT 
     event_type,
     ip_address,
     user_agent_hash,
     created_at,
     details
   FROM audit_logs 
   WHERE created_at BETWEEN '[start_time]' AND '[end_time]'
   ORDER BY created_at;
   ```

2. **Attack Vector Analysis**
   - Review security logs for entry point
   - Analyze malicious requests/payloads
   - Identify compromised accounts
   - Map lateral movement

3. **Impact Assessment**
   ```sql
   -- Count affected users
   SELECT 
     COUNT(*) as affected_users,
     wave_type,
     payment_status
   FROM waitlist_applications 
   WHERE updated_at > '[incident_start]'
   GROUP BY wave_type, payment_status;
   ```

#### Evidence Collection
- **System Logs**: Application, web server, database
- **Network Traffic**: If available
- **File System**: Changes, malware artifacts
- **User Activity**: Suspicious patterns
- **External Intelligence**: IOCs, TTPs

### Phase 4: Eradication & Recovery (4-24 hours)

#### Remove Threats
1. **Patch Vulnerabilities**
   ```typescript
   // Update vulnerable dependencies
   npm audit fix
   
   // Deploy security patches
   // Update configuration
   // Rotate compromised credentials
   ```

2. **Clean Infected Systems**
   ```bash
   # Remove malware/backdoors
   # Reset compromised accounts
   # Update security rules
   ```

3. **Strengthen Defenses**
   ```typescript
   // Implement additional monitoring
   // Update security policies
   // Enhance access controls
   ```

#### Recovery Process
1. **System Restoration**
   ```bash
   # Restore from clean backups if needed
   # Verify system integrity
   # Gradual service restoration
   ```

2. **Data Validation**
   ```sql
   -- Verify data integrity
   SELECT 
     COUNT(*) as total_applications,
     COUNT(CASE WHEN is_deleted = false THEN 1 END) as active_applications
   FROM waitlist_applications;
   
   -- Check for data corruption
   ```

3. **Gradual Reactivation**
   - Test systems thoroughly
   - Monitor for recurring issues
   - Gradually restore full functionality
